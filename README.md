This is a experimental prject demo to strengthned my programming skills. The project contains almost every functanilities to manage the hotel. 


The project was developed by using the java Swing, AWT, JFrame, MySQL and other libraries. It include the features such as Sign in or Sign up page, home page, reservation, room information, employee information, customer information and check in and check out information.
